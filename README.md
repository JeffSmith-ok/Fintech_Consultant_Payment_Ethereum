# Module_19_Challenge

I will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:

Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase (which you created earlier in the module).

Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

Once I receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, I will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that I have successfully created the transaction, I will save screenshots to the README.md file in my GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.
